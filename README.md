> The virgin 6-line if-else statement vs the chad one-liner ternary operator. Nothing says "I'm a coding sophisticate" like condensing a perfectly readable conditional into a cryptic single line that makes future maintainers question their career choices. The sunglasses really sell it - "Look at me, I just saved 5 whole lines and only sacrificed the entire team's sanity." Next up: replacing all your variable names with single letters to achieve true programming enlightenment.

## Personal Note

I *myself* have returned (a === 0), *and still do when I'm in a rush*.

## Reflection

All Core Counter functionality and Advanced Features (History Tracking, Auto-Save, Keyboard Listeners, Reset Mechanism) are implemented.

I used loads of console.log during the process.  Removed them all.  I think I'll leave them in next time, so I can do a mass 'find and replace' if I ever want to.  Typically my console.log these days look like (\`hSD invoked with count: ${count}, arrayOfCount: ${arrayOfCount}\`).
